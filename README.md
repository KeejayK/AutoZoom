*Note: Only works on Windows*  

`AutoZoom` is a tool for automated zoom joining and leaving. 

Users input **meeting ids**, **passwords**, **start times**, and **durations** into AutoZoom's intuitive GUI and the program handles the rest. AutoZoom will automatically open zoom meetings at their designated times and close them after the set duration has ended. When not in use, the program will quietly sleep in the background and will also run on startup in the event that the computer is shut down or restarted.

The A day and B day sections were a design choice to accomodate for the mcps high school zoom class schedule during the covid pandemic
